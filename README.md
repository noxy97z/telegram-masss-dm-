# How to use

<b>Suggestion: It is better to add by ID because if you add by username only users having usernames will be added. Moreover, it is slow</b>

* Run `start.bat`

# Note

Sometimes users may not get added at all, this may be because the account is probably limited or you entered a channel. Try with another account. 

# Warning

* This tool is official and completely free to use. Do not buy if anyone tries to sell by copying script
